-  For now as there are only few objects in the scene, so I dont use the Rep manager to manage the brdf datas, now for each primitive in the scene, it hold its brdf sh representation data


- Adaptive SH brdf are not considered!

- TODO: convert the index system from i to l,m 

- Using the precomputed  transfer matrix to store the data of brdf, using the fact that L = Y\*(B\*c) = (Y\*B)\*c
